**Mobile App**

Laboratory work No. 1 - App basic setup

Laboratory work No.1 consist in performing basic setup of mobile application on selected platform.

 - I have used Android Studio + Kotlin

Laboratory work task:

Init mobile application on selected platform.
- I have used Gradle in order to init my app

Create at least 2 screens which transfer data from one screen to another

Perform some data changes to data you received in screen No. 2 and pass it back to screen No. 1
- I have created two different activity, which are connected to each other via function
```
 #putExtra(String, String)
```

Add at least one active element on the screen, ex. button, text field and handle its action.
- I have added button "Change name" which perform action(in my case it changes string to the new one)
- I have added "back" button which move from one screen to another

Some not trivial action handling are welcome :)
Change Icon of the app to custom one
