Laboratory work No. 3 - Application API layer

Laboratory work consist in implementing API layer of your app.

 - I have used Android Studio + Kotlin

Laboratory work task:


Pick a theme for your app:
- I chose as theme "Translate App";

Pick an API it could be public or private:
- I chose the mockapi.io;

Implement at least 2 GET and 2 POST requests.t least 1 of your request should send data to API by request body in JSON format, but not by URL queries.
- I have used "Retrofit + coroutines" I made post and get requests in order to save and get the translated words. Also I have connected google translated API in order to translate the words.

I have created one more activity, which implement translate app functions:
- two fields with input a word and output of rhe translated word
 
- Also my app supports different screen sizes and orientation.
