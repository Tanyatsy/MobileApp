**Mobile App**

Laboratory work No. 2 - Basic layout and UI

Laboratory work consist in implementation of basic layout and UI of your app.

 - I have used Android Studio + Kotlin

Laboratory work task:

Pick a theme for your app:
- I chose as theme "Translate App";

Create at least 3 functional screens which transfer data from one screen to another. And at least one screen should display the list with 30 items.

- I have created three different activity, which implement translate app functions:
  - Main page + button which redirects to the next screen.
  - Second page with two buttons, which redirect to screen with the list and allow to add new words + back button to the main page.
  - Third page is the list page, which shows 30 items + new ones, which user has added + back button to the second screen.

- In order to implement the list with two columns or more I have used "RecyclerView". I have created a row layout for the items and use that layout inside my adapterList.

- Also my app supports different screen sizes and orientation is mandatory.
